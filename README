[---------------------COMPILING AND RUNNING-----------------------]
1.) Unpack the tarball into the appropriate directory
2.) Type "make" to compile using the makefile
3.) You should be compiled at this point, if not, use command "gcc -o chat chat.c -std=gnu99"
4.) To run, use "./chat" followed by "s" for server mode or "c" for client mode, followed by a port number

[--------------------COMMANDS-------------------------------------]
help - display a help screen

myip - display own IP address

myport - display current listening port

register <server-ip> <server-port> -
This will connect a client to a server specified by the ip and port given in the command. Upon registering, you will receive a list of all users currently registered with the server, along with their IPs and port numbers.

connect <peer-ip> <port> -
This will connect you to another client. A new TCP connection will be established between you, and that person's fd will be added to your own peer list. (accessed by LIST command)

list -
Displays a list of fds (sockets) that you can use with the SEND command. These are your connected peers. The first one is the server socket.

send <fd> - 
Opens a prompt that allows you to type a message to send through the specified socket.
NOTE: If the message does not appear on the other end, try hitting ENTER on the receiving end. This is a bug that is caused from getline halting on stdin on the first iteration of the loop. After that it should be fine.

terminate <fd> -
closes the socket fd

exit - 
sends a signal to the server and exits the program
